## Development Highlights

### 🔐 JotForm Integration Without Backend  
Integrated JotForm directly into the frontend using hidden fields and URL query parameters to auto-fill user data like name, phone, and email—removing the need for a traditional backend.

### 📦 State Preservation Across Pages  
Used React Router’s `useLocation` and `useSearchParams` to maintain user data across navigation, ensuring a seamless funnel flow from treatment selection to order confirmation.

### 📊 Conditional Rendering & UX Optimization  
Built a responsive cost comparison chart that adapts based on screen size and user selection, improving clarity and decision-making on both desktop and mobile.
